            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <img class="profilepic" src="#" alt="Profile Picture">

            <p>My name is Chigbu Bryan, and I am a passionate learner with a strong interest in technology, finance, and creativity. I am from Nigeria, and I’ve always been curious about how things work, especially in the world of computers and programming. 
                <br>My journey into web and computer development has been exciting, and I am constantly working to improve my skills. Right now, I’m learning different programming languages, including C#, and exploring how to build functional and engaging websites.
                <br>Aside from coding, I also have an interest in financial markets. I enjoy analyzing trends and understanding how money moves, as it challenges me to think critically and make informed decisions. I am also taking a career development and entrepreneurship course, 
                which is helping me prepare for future opportunities and teaching me valuable skills for success.
                <br>In my free time, I love playing video games and reading manga. Both hobbies allow me to unwind and fuel my creativity. As I continue learning and growing, I look forward to applying my skills in meaningful ways, whether through developing innovative websites, exploring new financial strategies, or even starting my own business one day. 
                <br>I am excited about the future and eager to see where my journey takes me.

            <h3>Nigeria: The Giant of Africa</h3>
            <div class="line"></div>
            <p>Nigeria, often referred to as the "Giant of Africa," is a vibrant and diverse country located in West Africa. 
                <br>With a population of over 200 million people, it is the most populous country on the continent and one of the largest economies in Africa. 
                <br>Nigeria is known for its rich cultural heritage, with over 250 ethnic groups and more than 500 languages spoken across the country. The three major ethnic groups are the Hausa-Fulani, Yoruba, and Igbo, each contributing to Nigeria’s unique traditions and way of life.
                <br>My country is blessed with abundant natural resources, including oil, natural gas, and agricultural products, making it a key player in global markets. Its entertainment industry, particularly Nollywood (Nigeria's film industry), is the second-largest in the world, producing thousands of movies every year. 
                <br><br>Additionally, Nigerian music, especially Afrobeats, has gained international recognition, with artists like Burna Boy, Wizkid, and Davido making waves across the globe.
                <br>Despite facing challenges such as political instability, economic fluctuations, and infrastructural issues, Nigeria remains a land of opportunity, resilience, and innovation. The spirit of its people is strong, with a deep sense of entrepreneurship and determination to succeed. As Nigeria continues to grow and evolve, it remains a powerful and influential nation in Africa and beyond.
