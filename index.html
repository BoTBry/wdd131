            <h2>About Me</h2>

            <img class="profilepic" src="#" alt="Profile Picture">

            <p>My name is Chigbu Bryan, and I am a passionate learner with a strong interest in technology, finance, and creativity. I am from Nigeria, and I’ve always been curious about how things work, especially in the world of computers and programming. 
                <br>My journey into web and computer development has been exciting, and I am constantly working to improve my skills. Right now, I’m learning different programming languages, including C#, and exploring how to build functional and engaging websites.
                <br>Aside from coding, I also have an interest in financial markets. I enjoy analyzing trends and understanding how money moves, as it challenges me to think critically and make informed decisions. I am also taking a career development and entrepreneurship course, 
                which is helping me prepare for future opportunities and teaching me valuable skills for success.
                <br><br>In my free time, I love playing video games and reading manga. Both hobbies allow me to unwind and fuel my creativity. As I continue learning and growing, I look forward to applying my skills in meaningful ways, whether through developing innovative websites, exploring new financial strategies, or even starting my own business one day. 
                <br>I am excited about the future and eager to see where my journey takes me.
